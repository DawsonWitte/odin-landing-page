# odin-landing-page
A repo for the Landing page assignment of The Odin Project

I have decided to make this webpage themed around Sun Tzu and the Art of War.
It seemed like a good combination of funny and creative in order for me to showcase my html and css skills. 

I learned a lot as I worked through the project and I almost want to redo it completely now that I am better with minupulating flexboxes.

I especially dont like how it shrinks and grows as I adjust the web page size, so that is something I would do differently on future websites.
